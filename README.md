# Stocky

[![Codeship Status for Stocky](https://codeship.com/projects/7d9d7560-8a2f-0132-c7fa-7acbd47feca1/status)](https://codeship.com/projects/59952)  


Stocky is an attempt at a stock prediction application built ontop of JavaML and WEKA.
It combines a lot of different algorithms and metrics.

## Code Example

The application is run by executing the StockyMain class. It will then load the options stored in
config.json. Below is an example config:

```json
{
    "symbols": [
        "AAPL",
        "AXS",
        "^OMX"
    ],
    "predictors": [
        "mlp"
    ],
    "pushoverRecipients": [
        ""
    ],
    "pushoverKey": ""
    ,
    "usedMetrics": [
        "mean_close",
        "high_to_mean",
        "mean_volume"
    ],
    "start": "2000-01-01",
    "periodSize": 5,
    "bootstrapp": false
}

```

* symbols - a list of stock identifiers
* predictor - what predictors to use
* pushoverRecipient - a list of Pushover user keys to send the results to
* pushoverKey - a Pushover API key
* usedMetrics - a list of the metrics to use in calculations
* start - the first date to get stock data from until now or finish
* periodSize - group days into periods, i.e. weeks, month etc.
* bootstrap - true if the program shall combine the predictors and bootstrap them

## Installation

The project uses maven to download all dependencies and all external libraries are included.

### Third-party libraries
Stocky build on top of several open source libraries:

* JavaML
* Weka
* GSON
* Joda-Time
* Pushover4j

## Tests

JUnit tests are kept in src/test.
